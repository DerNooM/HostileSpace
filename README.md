# HostileSpace

Hostile Space is a space "hack and slay" kind of game.
it will be played from a 2d top down perspective.
the levels will be seperated in smaller chunks
of space with a tougher boss at the end of each.
the player will have a spaceship and slay through hordes 
of enemy spaceships. meanwhile he will research new
weapons, armor, shields and energy generators.
