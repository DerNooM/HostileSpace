# HostileSpace

Hostile Space is a space "hack and slay" kind of game.
the player will have a spaceship and slay through hordes 
of enemy spaceships. meanwhile he will research new
weapons, armor, shields and energy generators.

the whole game will be client/server base (even the singleplayer)

there might come an 1v1, 5vs5 and coop mode.
